This website validates data entered by you in accordance with Benford's law. Unlike most websites out there on the internet, this one adds equations referring to the Chi-Squared Stat and the p-value, which are forms of validation of the method. These algorithms tell you how far your data is from Benford's law, and therefore how likely it is to be faked or manipulated, as random sequences from nature tend to follow the law.
